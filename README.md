# Flower Classification using CNN with Data Augmentation

This repository contains a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) code for flower classification using data augmentation. The code demonstrates how to train a CNN model to classify different types of flowers using a dataset and augmenting the data to improve model performance.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or later)

TensorFlow (version 2.0 or later)

Keras (version 2.3 or later)

NumPy

Matplotlib

## Dataset
The code assumes that you have a dataset of flower images organized into different classes. Each class should have its own folder containing the respective flower images. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets.
